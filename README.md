# CUB 3D

## :suspect: Overview
**CUB 3D** is a project from the 42 School curriculum focused on creating a 3D game engine that implements the raycasting technique, inspired by an absolute pioneer of 3D shooter and what is globaly known to be the first FPS (DOOM), The goal is to render a 3D world from a given 2D map and to provide a playable environment where users can navigate through it.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### :goberserk: Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed (GCC recommended).
- **Make**: A build system to compile the project.
- **MLX (MiniLibX)**: A graphical library required to handle graphics.

### :suspect: Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cub3d.git
   ```
2. Access the File:
```
   cd cub3d
```
3. Compile and run the program: (important to note that when making the mlx42 library will also compile with it)
```
  make
  ./cub3D valid.cub
```
### :finnadie: Usage :
- To play the game, you may use the following controls:

  W: Move forward
  S: Move backward
  A: Move left
  D: Move right
  Arrow Keys: Look around

### :rage1: Features:

1- Raycasting engine to render 3D graphics from a 2D map.

2- Player movement and controls for navigation.

3- Wall Collision for a more immersed fealing.

4- Support for different texturing using images in .png format.

5- Configurable map files in .cub format.

### :godmode: Acknowledgements
Special thanks to 42 School for providing the curriculum and guidelines for this project.
Inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D game and its raycasting techniques.
